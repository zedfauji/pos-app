2. **Validation Error**: Clear error messages for invalid inputs
3. **API Error**: Backend error handling with user-friendly messages
4. **Timeout**: Proper timeout handling with cancellation

### ✅ **Edge Cases**
1. **Partial Payment**: Support for split payments and multiple payment methods
2. **Discount Application**: Bill-level discount functionality
3. **Receipt Generation**: Pro forma and final receipt printing
4. **Concurrent Operations**: Thread-safe pane management
