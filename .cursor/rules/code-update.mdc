DO NOT RUN dotnet build MagiDesk.sln -c Debug -nologo
Build Blocking Rule

Every time code is generated, edited, or refactored, immediately run a build for the affected module(s).

The model must not mark the task complete or proceed to other features until:

The build finishes with no errors (dotnet build, or solution-level build for WinUI/frontend/backend modules).

All warnings are resolved if they cause runtime or XAML issues.

The output binaries are generated successfully.

Error Recovery Rule

If build fails, the model must:

Analyze the error output in detail.

Suggest and apply specific fixes.

Re-run the build.

This loop must continue until build passes.

Do not continue development or move to other tasks while errors exist.

ðŸš€ Deployment Rule

After a successful build, if deployment is configured , run the deployment pipeline for that module.

Deployment must also pass without errors before proceeding
