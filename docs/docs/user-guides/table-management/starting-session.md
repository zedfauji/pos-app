## When to Start a Session

**Start a session when:**
- Customers sit down at a table
- You assign a table to customers
- Before taking any orders for that table

**Why it's important:**
- Starts the timer (calculates time cost)
- Allows you to take orders
- Tracks the table as occupied
- Generates accurate bills

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Find an Available Table

**Look for:**
- Green table (available)
- Table number you want to use
- Table that's clean and ready

**On the dashboard, you'll see:**
- Billiard tables (pool tables)
- Bar tables (regular tables)
- Each table shows its status

### Step 2: Click on the Table

**Click on the green table** you want to start

**What you'll see:**
- Table details panel appears (right side)
- Table information
- Action buttons

### Step 3: Start the Session

**Click "Start Session" button**

**A dialog will appear asking:**
- Select server name
- Confirm table number

### Step 4: Select Your Name

**From the dropdown, select your name**

**This is important because:**
- It tracks which server is handling the table
- It appears on the bill
- It's used for reporting

### Step 5: Confirm and Start

**Click "Start" button**

**What happens:**
- ✅ Table turns red (occupied)
- ✅ Timer starts automatically
- ✅ Session is created
- ✅ You can now add items

**You'll see:**
- Table status: "Occupied"
- Your name as the server
- Timer showing "0 minutes" (will count up)
- "Add Items" button appears

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

**The system:**
1. Creates a session record
2. Generates a unique session ID
3. Starts tracking time
4. Links the session to the table
5. Marks table as occupied

**You don't need to worry about this** - it happens automatically!

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Don't Forget!

**Solutions:**
1. Try again (may be temporary)
2. Refresh the page
3. Log out and log back in
