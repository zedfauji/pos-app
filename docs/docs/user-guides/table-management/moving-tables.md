## When to Move Tables

**Move tables when:**

- Table needs to be freed for other use
- Better table becomes available
- Customers request different location

**Why it's useful:**
- Keeps order history together
- Maintains accurate billing
- Preserves session information

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Method 1: Using Move Table Feature

**If available in your system:**

1. **Click on the current table** (occupied, red)
2. **Click "Move Table" or "Transfer" button**
3. **Select destination table** from list
4. **Confirm the move**
5. **System transfers:**
   - Session to new table
   - Order to new table
   - All information preserved

**What happens:**
- ✅ Old table becomes available (green)
- ✅ New table becomes occupied (red)
- ✅ Order moves with customers
- ✅ Session continues (timer keeps running)
- ✅ All items preserved

### Method 2: Manual Move (If Feature Not Available)

**If move feature isn't available:**

1. **Note the current order:**
   - Write down all items
   - Note quantities
   - Check current total

2. **Stop current session:**
   - Click on current table
   - Click "Stop Session"
   - **Don't process payment yet**

3. **Start new session:**
   - Click on new table (green)
   - Click "Start Session"
   - Select your name
   - Start session

4. **Add existing items:**
   - Click "Add Items"
   - Add all items from previous order
   - Enter correct quantities
   - Confirm order

5. **Continue with new table:**
   - Session continues on new table
   - Order is recreated
   - Process payment when ready

**Note:** This method creates a new order, but preserves the items.

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Before Moving

- **Verify customers want to move**
- **Check new table is available**
- **Note current order items**
- **Check session duration** (if time-based billing)

### ✅ Best Practices

- Use move feature if available (preserves everything)
- Verify all items transfer correctly
- Check order total matches
- Confirm new table is correct
- Inform customers of the move

### ❌ Common Mistakes

- Moving to occupied table
- Losing order items
- Forgetting to stop old session
- Starting new session without transferring items

---

## Special Situations

### Moving with Active Order

**If items are being prepared:**
- Order status may show "Preparing"
- Items will still transfer
- Kitchen/bar will see updated table number
- No items are lost

### Moving with Time-Based Billing

**If table charges by time:**
- Timer continues running
- Time cost accumulates
- Total time includes both tables
- Bill reflects total duration

### Moving Multiple Times

**If customers move again:**
- Can move as many times as needed
- Each move preserves order
- Total time includes all tables
- Final bill is accurate

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Destination Table is Occupied"

**What it means:** New table already has customers

**Solution:**
- Choose different table
- Wait for table to become available
- Ask manager for help

### Problem: "Items Didn't Transfer"

**What to do:**
- Check order on new table
- Add missing items manually
- Verify all items are present
- Contact manager if items are lost

### Problem: "Old Table Still Shows Occupied"

**What to do:**
- Verify move completed
- Check old table status
- May need to manually free old table
