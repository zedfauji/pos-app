# Creating an Order

This guide explains how to create an order for customers at a table.

---

## When to Create an Order

**Create an order when:**
- Customers are ready to order
- You've started a table session
- Customers tell you what they want

**Note:** In MagiDesk POS, orders are created automatically when you add items to a table session. You don't need to create an "empty" order first.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**Before taking orders:**
- ✅ Table session must be started

- ✅ Your name should be on the table
