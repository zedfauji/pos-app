## Script

### [INTRODUCTION - 15 seconds]

### [MAIN CONTENT - 2 minutes 30 seconds]

#### Step 1: Opening the Application (20 seconds)

"First, you need to open the MagiDesk POS application. On your computer, find the MagiDesk icon and double-click it. The application will open, and you'll see the login screen."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Open application, show login screen]**

"The login screen has two fields: one for your username and one for your password."

**[HIGHLIGHT: Username and password fields]**

---

#### Step 2: Entering Your Username (15 seconds)

"Enter your username in the first field. Your username was given to you by your manager. It's usually your first name and last name, or your employee ID."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Type username]**

"Type your username carefully. Make sure there are no typos."

---

#### Step 3: Entering Your Password (20 seconds)

"Now, enter your password in the password field. When you first log in, you'll use a temporary password that your manager gave you."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Type password, show it's hidden with dots]**

"Notice that the password is hidden with dots for security. That's normal - you won't see what you're typing."

---

#### Step 4: First-Time Password Change (30 seconds)

"If this is your first time logging in, the system will ask you to change your password. This is for security. You'll need to enter your temporary password, then create a new password."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Password change dialog if applicable]**

"Your new password should be at least 8 characters long and include both letters and numbers. Make sure it's something you'll remember, but don't make it too simple."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Entering new password]**

"Enter your new password twice to confirm it, then click 'Change Password'."

---

#### Step 5: Clicking Login (10 seconds)

"Once you've entered your username and password, click the 'Login' button."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click login button]**

"The system will verify your credentials and log you in."

---

#### Step 6: Successful Login (20 seconds)

"If your username and password are correct, you'll see the main dashboard. This is your home screen where you'll see all your tables."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show dashboard after login]**

"If you see an error message, double-check your username and password. Make sure Caps Lock is off, and try again."

**[SHOW: Error message example if applicable]**

"If you still can't log in, ask your manager for help."

---

#### Step 7: Logging Out (20 seconds)

"At the end of your shift, you should log out. Click your name in the top right corner, then click 'Logout'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Logout process]**

"This keeps your account secure and prevents others from using it."

---

### [SUMMARY - 15 seconds]

"To summarize: Open the MagiDesk application, enter your username and password, click 'Login', and you'll see the dashboard. If this is your first time, you'll need to change your password. Always log out at the end of your shift."
