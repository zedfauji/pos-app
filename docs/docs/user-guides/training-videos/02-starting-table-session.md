## Script

### [INTRODUCTION - 15 seconds]

"Welcome back to MagiDesk POS training. In this video, we'll learn how to start a table session when customers arrive. This is one of the most important things you'll do as a server. Let's get started."

**[PAUSE - Show dashboard with tables]**

---

### [MAIN CONTENT - 2 minutes 30 seconds]

#### Step 1: Understanding Table Status (25 seconds)

"First, let's understand what the colors mean. When you look at the dashboard, you'll see tables in different colors."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show green and red tables]**

"Green tables are available - no customers are sitting there. Red tables are occupied - customers are already there, and a session is active."

**[HIGHLIGHT: Green table, then red table]**

"When customers sit down at a green table, you need to start a session to track their order and time."

---

#### Step 2: Clicking on the Table (15 seconds)

"When customers sit down, click on the green table they're at."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click on a green table]**

"You'll see the table details appear, showing the table number and status."

---

#### Step 3: Starting the Session (30 seconds)

"Now, click the 'Start Session' button."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click "Start Session" button]**

"A dialog will appear asking you to select your name. This is important because it tracks which server is handling this table."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show dialog with name selection]**

"Select your name from the list. If you don't see your name, ask your manager to add you to the system."

---

#### Step 4: Confirming the Start (15 seconds)

"After selecting your name, click the 'Start' button."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click "Start" button]**

"The session will begin, and the table will turn red, showing it's now occupied."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Table turns red]**

---

#### Step 5: Understanding What Happens (25 seconds)

"Once the session starts, a timer begins counting how long customers have been at the table. This is important because some tables charge by time."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show timer if visible]**

"You can now add items to the order. We'll cover that in the next video."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show "Add Items" button]**

"The table will stay red until you stop the session when customers are ready to pay."

---

#### Step 6: What If It Doesn't Work? (20 seconds)

"If you try to start a session and get an error, there are a few things to check."

**[SHOW: Error message example if applicable]**

"First, make sure the table is really green and available. If it's red, another session might already be active. Check with your manager if you're not sure."

"Second, make sure you selected your name. If your name isn't in the list, ask your manager to add you."

---

#### Step 7: Multiple Tables (20 seconds)

"You can have multiple table sessions active at the same time. Each table you start will turn red, and you can switch between them by clicking on different tables."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show multiple red tables]**

"Just remember to start a session for every table where customers sit down."

---

### [SUMMARY - 15 seconds]

"To summarize: When customers sit down at a green table, click on the table, click 'Start Session', select your name, and click 'Start'. The table will turn red, and you're ready to take their order."

---

### [OUTRO - 10 seconds]

"Thanks for watching. In the next video, we'll learn how to create an order by adding items. See you then!"
