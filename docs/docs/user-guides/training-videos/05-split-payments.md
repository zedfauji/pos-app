## Script

### [INTRODUCTION - 15 seconds]

"Welcome back to MagiDesk POS training. In this video, we'll learn how to process split payments when customers want to pay separately. This is common when groups of friends want to split the bill. Let's get started."

**[PAUSE - Show bill ready for payment]**

### [MAIN CONTENT - 4 minutes 20 seconds]

#### Step 1: Understanding Split Payments (25 seconds)

"Split payments allow customers to pay the same bill using different payment methods or splitting the amount between multiple people."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show bill]**

"For example, one person might pay with cash, another with a card, and another with mobile payment. Or they might split the total amount equally between them."

---

#### Step 2: Opening Payment Screen (15 seconds)

"After stopping the table session and reviewing the bill, click 'Process Payment'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click "Process Payment"]**

"On the payment screen, look for the 'Split Payment' button or option."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show "Split Payment" button]**

---

#### Step 3: Starting Split Payment (20 seconds)

"Click 'Split Payment' to begin."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click "Split Payment"]**

"You'll see options for how to split the payment. Common options include: Split equally, Split by amount, Split by percentage, or Split by items."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show split options]**

---

#### Step 4: Method 1 - Split Equally (30 seconds)

"If customers want to split the bill equally, select 'Split Equally'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Select "Split Equally"]**

"Enter how many people are splitting. For example, if 3 people are splitting a $90 bill, enter 3."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Enter number of people]**

"The system will calculate how much each person owes. In this case, $30 each."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show calculation]**

---

#### Step 5: Processing First Payment (30 seconds)

"Now, process the first payment. Select the payment method for the first person - let's say Cash."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Select Cash for first payment]**

"The amount is already filled in - $30 in this example. Click 'Process Payment'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Process first payment]**

"After the first payment is processed, you'll see the remaining balance."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show remaining balance]**

---

#### Step 6: Processing Second Payment (25 seconds)

"Now process the second payment. Select the payment method for the second person - let's say Credit Card."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Select Credit Card]**

"The amount is already filled in. Click 'Process Payment'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Process second payment]**

"The remaining balance will decrease."

---

#### Step 7: Processing Remaining Payments (25 seconds)

"Continue processing payments for each person until the entire bill is paid."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Process third payment if applicable]**

"Each payment reduces the remaining balance. When the remaining balance reaches zero, the split payment is complete."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show balance reaching zero]**

---

#### Step 8: Method 2 - Split by Amount (30 seconds)

"Another way to split is by entering specific amounts. Select 'Split by Amount'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Select "Split by Amount"]**

"Enter how much each person wants to pay. For example, Person 1 pays $40, Person 2 pays $30, Person 3 pays $20."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Enter amounts]**

"Make sure the amounts add up to the total bill. Then process each payment as before."

---

#### Step 9: Method 3 - Split by Items (30 seconds)

"Some systems allow splitting by items. This means each person pays for the items they ordered."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show "Split by Items" if available]**

"Select the items for the first person, then process their payment. Then select items for the second person, and so on."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show item selection if applicable]**

"This is useful when people ordered different things and want to pay only for what they ordered."

---

#### Step 10: Completing Split Payment (20 seconds)

"Once all payments are processed and the balance is zero, the split payment is complete."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show zero balance]**

"The table will turn green, and receipts will print for each payment."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show receipts printing]**

"Give each person their receipt."

---

#### Step 11: What If Amounts Don't Match? (20 seconds)

"If the split amounts don't add up to the total bill, the system will show an error."

**[SHOW: Error message example if applicable]**

"Make sure all amounts add up to the total. You can adjust amounts until they match."

---

### [SUMMARY - 15 seconds]

"To summarize: Click 'Split Payment', choose how to split (equally, by amount, or by items), process each payment one by one, and continue until the balance is zero. Each person gets their own receipt."

---

### [OUTRO - 10 seconds]

"Thanks for watching. In the next video, we'll learn how to apply discounts when managers approve them. See you then!"
