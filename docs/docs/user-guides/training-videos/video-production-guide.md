[MAIN CONTENT - 5 minutes]
"First, you'll see the dashboard with all your tables. Tables that are available are shown in green. Tables that are occupied are shown in red.

When customers sit down at a table, you need to start a session. Let me show you how.

Click on the available table - you'll see it's green, which means it's free. Now, click the 'Start Session' button.

A dialog will appear asking you to select your name. Select your name from the list, then click 'Start'.

The table will now turn red, showing it's occupied. The session has started, and the timer begins counting how long customers have been at the table.

You can now add items to the order. We'll cover that in the next video."

[SUMMARY - 10 seconds]
"To summarize: Click on an available green table, click 'Start Session', select your name, and click 'Start'. The table will turn red, and you're ready to take orders."
