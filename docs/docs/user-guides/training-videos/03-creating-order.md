## Script

### [INTRODUCTION - 15 seconds]

"Welcome back to MagiDesk POS training. In this video, we'll learn how to create an order by adding items. This is what you'll do after starting a table session. Let's get started."

**[PAUSE - Show occupied table]**

---

### [MAIN CONTENT - 4 minutes 20 seconds]

#### Step 1: Opening the Add Items Screen (20 seconds)

"After you've started a table session, you need to add items to the order. Click on the occupied table - you'll see it's red now."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click on red table]**

"Then click the 'Add Items' button."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click "Add Items" button]**

"The menu will appear, showing all available items."

---

#### Step 2: Understanding the Menu (30 seconds)

"The menu is organized by categories. You'll see categories like Food, Drinks, Snacks, and so on."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show categories]**

"Click on a category to see items in that category, or use the search bar to find items quickly."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show search bar]**

"Items that are out of stock will be grayed out and you won't be able to add them."

---

#### Step 3: Finding an Item (25 seconds)

"Let's say the customer wants a beer. I'll click on the 'Drinks' category."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click "Drinks" category]**

"Or I can type 'beer' in the search bar."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Type in search bar, show results]**

"Either way, I'll see the beer options available."

---

#### Step 4: Selecting an Item (20 seconds)

"Click on the item the customer wants. Let's say they want a 'House Beer'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click on item]**

"You'll see the item details: the name, description, and price."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show item details]**

---

#### Step 5: Entering Quantity (25 seconds)

"Now, enter the quantity. If the customer wants one beer, the default is 1, which is fine. But if they want two beers, change it to 2."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Change quantity to 2]**

"Enter the quantity carefully - this affects the total price."

---

#### Step 6: Adding Modifiers (Optional) (30 seconds)

"Some items have modifiers - these are options like size, toppings, or customizations."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show modifiers if available]**

"For example, a pizza might have size options: Small, Medium, or Large. Or you might be able to add extra cheese or remove onions."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Select modifier if applicable]**

"If there are modifiers, select the ones the customer wants. If not, you can skip this step."

---

#### Step 7: Adding to Cart (20 seconds)

"Once you've selected the item and quantity, and any modifiers, click 'Add to Order' or 'Add to Cart'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click "Add to Order"]**

"The item will be added to your cart, and you'll see it at the bottom or side of the screen."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show cart with item]**

---

#### Step 8: Adding More Items (25 seconds)

"You can continue adding more items. Let's say the customer also wants a pizza."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Find and add another item]**

"Click on the pizza, enter the quantity, add any modifiers, and click 'Add to Order'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Add second item]**

"The cart will show both items now, with a running total."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show cart with multiple items]**

---

#### Step 9: Reviewing the Cart (30 seconds)

"Before confirming the order, review your cart. Make sure:"

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show cart details]**

"All items are correct, quantities are right, modifiers are correct, and the total looks reasonable."

**[HIGHLIGHT: Each item, quantity, total]**

"If something is wrong, you can remove items from the cart or change quantities before confirming."

---

#### Step 10: Confirming the Order (25 seconds)

"Once everything looks good, click 'Confirm Order' or 'Submit'."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Click "Confirm Order"]**

"The order will be sent to the kitchen or bar, and you'll see a confirmation message."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show confirmation]**

"The items will appear in the order list, and the order total will update."

---

#### Step 11: Adding Items Later (20 seconds)

"You can add more items to the order later. Just click 'Add Items' again, select the items, and confirm. The new items will be added to the existing order."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Add another item to existing order]**

---

#### Step 12: What If an Item is Out of Stock? (20 seconds)

"If an item is out of stock, it will be grayed out and you won't be able to add it."

**[DEMONSTRATE: Show grayed-out item]**

"Inform the customer and suggest alternatives. The system prevents you from adding unavailable items."

---

### [SUMMARY - 15 seconds]
