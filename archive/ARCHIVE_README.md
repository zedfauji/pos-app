# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files, scripts, and documentation that are no longer actively used but are preserved for historical reference.

## Structure

- **status-documents/**: Status and progress markdown files from development phases
- **test-scripts/**: Test and diagnostic scripts that are no longer in active use
- **old-code/**: Deprecated code files and old implementations

## Archive Policy

Files are archived when:
- They represent completed phases or milestones
- They are superseded by newer implementations
- They are test/diagnostic scripts no longer needed
- They are status documents from completed work

## Restoration

If you need to restore any archived file, check the individual archive notes in each subdirectory.
