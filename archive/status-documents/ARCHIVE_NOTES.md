# Archive Notes - Status Documents

This directory contains status and progress markdown files from various development phases.

## Archived Files

These files document the progress and status of various features and implementations:

- **RBAC_*.md**: Role-Based Access Control implementation progress and test results

- **DEVELOPER_PORTAL_*.md**: Developer portal setup and planning documents
- **REFUND_*.md**: Refund implementation progress
- **Other status documents**: Various feature implementation status documents

## Why Archived

These files were archived because:
- They represent completed phases or milestones
- They are superseded by comprehensive documentation in `/docs`
- They are historical records of development progress
- They are no longer needed for active development

## Access

If you need to reference these documents:
1. They are preserved here for historical reference
2. Key information has been incorporated into the main documentation
3. Contact maintainers if you need specific information from these files

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these files, they can be moved back to the root directory. However, consider if the information should be incorporated into the main documentation instead.
