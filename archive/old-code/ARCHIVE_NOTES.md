# Archive Notes - Old Code

This directory contains deprecated code files and old implementations.

## Archived Files

- **Program.cs**: Test program for JSON deserialization (no longer needed)

## Why Archived

These files were archived because:
- They are test/example code no longer in use
- They are superseded by current implementations
- They are not part of the main codebase

## Restoration

If you need any of these files:
1. Review for current relevance
2. Consider if functionality should be in test projects
3. Move back if needed for reference
